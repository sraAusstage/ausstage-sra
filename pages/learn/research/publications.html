      <content><![CDATA[<h1>Publications</h1>
<p>A selection of publications by AusStage researchers documenting the development of the database and demonstrating data-driven methodologies for researching live performance.</p>
<h2>Bollen, Jonathan and Julie Holledge, 'Cartographic Revelations in the World of Theatre Studies', <em>The Cartographic Journal</em>, 48, 4, November 2011, 226-236</h2>
<p>Et dukkehjem (A Doll&rsquo;s House) by Henrik Ibsen is one of the most performed modern dramas in the world. Using cartographic and network visualisations, this article divulges a hitherto obscured Nordic history of this play: first, as a product of the cultural and aesthetic blending in the late nineteenth century; then as an icon of nation building in the post- war years; and finally, as a global icon for the Norwegian nation state. While charting this affair between Norway and one of its national cultural treasures, this article also exposes the transmission of an aesthetic heritage. Network visualisations of the Nordic productions of Et dukkehjem reveal an unbroken connection between productions of the play from 1879 to 1991. Oral transmission of production knowledge concerning canonical texts is commonplace in most national theatres, but this is the first study to document the phenomenon within the interpretative history of a single play. By applying time-geography to the production history of a ubiquitous dramatic text, &lsquo;Hidden Dramas&rsquo; demonstrates the value of cartographic investigations to the field of theatre historiography.</p>
<h2>Seton, Mark and Tom Burvill, 'Access to digitized performance documentation and the AusStage database', <em>Studies in Theatre and Performance</em>, 30, 3, Nov 2010, 305-321</h2>
<p>The digitization of video documentation and other production documentation (photographic images, scripts, programmes, reviews, stage designs and audio recordings) of live performances can be accessed across the world through the Internet. At the same time, protocols requisite for the effective flow of data constrain how digitized artefacts of an innately ephemeral process are &quot;packaged&quot; and linked for appropriate accessibility. Ironically, the digitization of such ephemera by no means guarantees their permanence as digital formats and modes of storage and retrieval are constantly vulnerable to changing industry standards and competitive commercial interests. Burvill and Seton track their experiences and reflections in pursuing the process of preparing an existing physical archive of an Australian, nationally regarded, community theatre company Sidetrack Performance Group (formerly Sidetrack Theatre Company, <a href="%(link0)">http://www.sidetrack.com.au</a>) for digitization and archiving into a university E-Repository. This archive is linked to the AusStage database providing an accessible research facility for investigating live performances and, simultaneously, informing histories of theatre and performance in Australia. The dynamic of enabling and constraining, at the same time, is highlighted as guidelines are formulated for the digitization, archiving and linking of performance assets so that the values of respect, integrity, justice and beneficence are applied to all stakeholders in the process. Note: This article refers to records in ResearchOnline included in the Sidetrack Theatre Collection.</p>
<h2>Tompkins, Joanne, Helena Grehan and Neal Harvey, 'AusStage: From Database of Performing Arts to a Performing Database of the Arts', in <em>Resourceful Reading: The New Empiricism, eResearch and Australian Literary Culture</em>, Sydney University Press, Sydney, NSW, 2009, 325-333.</h2>
<p>AusStage, the database of Australian performing arts events, has in 2008 seen the beginning of a new phase of development: the integration of external critical resources and databases with event-related data. This paper offers a case study report of the past eighteen months' work by one component of the AusStage team. Via a live Internet connection, this presentation will reveal the new functionality of the AusStage database and discuss the proposed direction that the project will take from this point. AusStage, a freely-accessible national database of Australian performing arts built by a consortium of universities and industry partners, now contains database records on over 47,000 performing arts events, their associated venues along with the organisations and professionals involved. While the long-term goal to index and audit Australia's performing arts history continues, AusStage has now begun to implement the technology that will enable it to create and sustain links with other digital repositories. The first step of this process is to begin associating the data contained in AusStage with presently existing critical resources. The proof-of-concept work for this part of the project was undertaken in three different strands: associating critical literature in the form of books; Australasian Drama Studies articles and RealTime articles. This paper discusses the process of associating each of these different types of resources with existing digital resources to argue that the usefulness of repositories like AusStage can only benefit from increasing accessibility and connectivity with other digital collections and discourses.</p>
<h2>Bollen, Jonathan, Neal Harvey, Julie Holledge and Glen McGillivray, 'AusStage: e-Research in the Performing Arts', <em>Australasian Drama Studies</em>, 54, Apr 2009, 178-194</h2>
<p>Over the last eight years scholars across Australia have been working to develop an innovative eResearch facility for the performing arts. Now in its third phase of development, AusStage brings together a diverse range of partners including university researchers, industry organisations, government agencies and postgraduate students by providing network infrastructure for storing and exchanging research information. At its core is the AusStage database of the Australian performing arts, which is freely accessible at <a href="%(link1)">http://www.ausstage.edu.au</a>. This article reports on a panel session at the eResearch Australasia 2008 conference in Melbourne. It summarises the development of AusStage and explores new eResearch methodologies and their application to performing arts research through three case studies in the areas of time mapping, network visualisation and blogging. To establish the context for this work, we first review the history of the AusStage project, describing the development of the database and its design.</p>]]></content>
