      <content><![CDATA[<h1>Industry</h1>
<p>AusStage developed as a partnership between industry organisations and university researchers with funding from the Australian Research Council. Industry partners in phase 4 include the <a href="%(link0)">Australia Council for the Arts</a>, <a href="%(link1)">Windmill Performing Arts</a>, and the Performing Arts Special Interest Group of Museums Australia.</p>
<p>Partnerships with industry enable data sets of particular significance to&nbsp;a&nbsp;venue, company or artist to be recorded in AusStage.&nbsp;This may take the form of a&nbsp;financial contribution for data entry or an in-kind contribution of labour. Many performing arts <a target="_self" href="%(link2)">collections</a> are using AusStage to integrate information on their holdings withinthe national dataset. AusStage&nbsp;provides on-site training in data entry and&nbsp;ongoing support to sustain data quality.</p>
<p>In 2008 <a href="%(link3)">Melbourne Theatre Company</a> funded a thorough update of AusStage records from its beginnings as the <a href="%(link4)">Union Theatre Repertory Company</a> in 1953 until the present day. Completion aimed to coincide with the MTC's arrival in its new home opposite the Arts Centre. Cross-checking company records with published histories and web-based resources, each record includes a brief synopsis, complete cast and crew lists, accurate performance dates and appropriate content indicators to better facilitate research-based queries. As the oldest surviving theatre company in Australia, it is fitting that the MTC's records should serve as a benchmark for other institutions&nbsp;in our national performance database.</p>
<p>AusStage set up the <a href="%(link5)" target="_self">Data Exchange</a> for artists and companies to embed data from AusStage in their own websites. We are collaborating with <a href="%(link6)">AustralianPlays.org</a> to link information on playwrights and their play scripts to the production history of their plays.</p>
<p>AusStage provides customised queries, searches and reports to assist organisations like the <a target="_self" href="%(link7)">Australia Council for the Arts</a> and <a target="_self" href="%(link8)">Playwriting Australia</a> to answer questions about the composition of performing arts programming, the distribution of touring productions, and patterns of collaboration between artists.</p>
