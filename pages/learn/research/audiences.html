<h2>Inviting feedback from audiences using mobile devices</h2>
<p>The <a href="%(link0)" target="_self">Researching Audiences</a> service provides audience members&nbsp;with opportunities to share their experiences of performance.</p>
<p>Recording audience responses to performance is important for companies, researchers, performers and spectators. It enriches our knowledge about the experience of performance, and it will provide future generations with a richer and fuller understanding of what we did, saw, liked and didn't like.</p>
<p>Artists and companies can&nbsp;select questions to&nbsp;put to their&nbsp;audiences. They can view audience responses to a particular performance in various ways - as a list in chronological order, as signage for use at a venue, as a tag cloud of key words, or as a sequence of images retrieved for key words. They can also select multiple performances for viewing as a list or as a tag cloud.</p>
<p>Spectators can use mobile phones to send text messages, tweet via Twitter or respond online via a mobile web site. Spectators can also register with AusStage to leave comments about performances on the AusStage website.</p>
