      <content><![CDATA[<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p>AusStage is committed to protecting the privacy of the individuals whose information is stored within the database.</p>
<p>AusStage is subject to the <a href="%(link0)">Privacy Act 1988</a> and operates in accordance with the <a href="%(link1)">Information Privacy Principles</a>. Under the Act and its Principles, an organisation may collect personal information from generally available publications and make this information available to the public, as long as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the collection of the information is necessary for the organisation's functions and activities;</li>
    <li>the organisation collects the information by lawful and fair means; and</li>
    <li>the organisation takes reasonable steps to ensure that the information collected is accurate, complete and up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
<p>An organisation may also collect information directly from individuals, as long as that individual is aware of the purposes for which the information is being collected.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Privacy for Artists and Authors</h2>
<p>AusStage respects the privacy of the artists and authors whose work is the subject of data collection. We will respond directly to enquiries from individuals about the information concerning their work and the sources from which the information was collected. We particularly welcome contact from individuals who can assist in improving the accuracy and extent of information in AusStage.</p>
<p>AusStage collects information from generally available publications, such as newspapers, journals, books, websites, advertisements and theatre programs. In some cases, individuals contribute information directly to AusStage by forwarding resumes and submitting data online. In all cases, AusStage records the source of information used to create event records.</p>
<p>Where individuals have provided AusStage with information and the permission to publish that information, AusStage will store a record of the individual's permission and publish the information accordingly. AusStage will not publish or make available to a third party any information that may be considered private or that is not publicly available elsewhere. For example, where AusStage has recorded an individual's date of birth, this information will not be made publicly available until we have also recorded and confirmed an individual's date of death.</p>
<h2>Privacy for Users</h2>
<p>AusStage respects the privacy of its users. Where users provide personal information to AusStage (such as their email address when registering as a user), AusStage will respect the privacy of this information and use it only for the purpose under which it was provided. AusStage will not pass users&rsquo; personal information on to a third party.</p>
<p>The AusStage website includes features which invite contributions  from users. These contributions are recorded by AusStage and made publicly  available on the website. Users are advised not to contribute private  information that they do not wish to make publicly available. The <a href="%(link2)" target="_self">Terms of Use</a> describe the conditions under which users contribute content to AusStage.</p>
<p>When you use AusStage, we record information which identifies, for each page accessed, the internet protocol address of the machine which accessed it, the date and time of visit to the site, the pages accessed and documents downloaded, the previous site visited, the type of browser used and operating system. AusStage aggregates, analyses and publishes this information about usage patterns, in a manner which does not permit the identification of individual users or their machines.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy, please <a target="_self" href="%(link3)">contact</a> us.</p>]]></content>
