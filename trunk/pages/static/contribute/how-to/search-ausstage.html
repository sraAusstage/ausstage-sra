<h2><a name="Basic_Search">Basic Search</a></h2>

    <li>a playwright, an actor, a director or an artist</li>

    <li>... or a combination of these.</li>

<p>To focus your search, you may also select from the following options.</p>
<h3>Search for</h3>
<p>Select what you want to search for.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>All Records</strong> (default). This search retrieves a list of events matching your search words by searching across all events, and associated venues, contributors, organisations and resources.</li>
    <li><strong>Events</strong>. An event is a discrete happening, defined by title, date and venue, typically a performance or&nbsp;run of performances at a venue. The search will retrieve a list of matching events.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Contributors</strong>. A contributor is an individual involved in the conception, production and presentation of events. The search will retrieve a list of matching contributors.</li>
    <li><strong>Organisations</strong>. An organisation is&nbsp;a group or company involved in the conception, production and presentation of events. The search will retrieve a list of matching organisations.</li>
    <li><strong>Venues</strong>. A venue is a place where an event happens. The search will retrieve a list of matching venues.</li>
    <li><strong>Resources</strong>.&nbsp;A resource is&nbsp;a review, programme, photograph, video, book, article, collection etc. Resources&nbsp;record information about events, contributors, organisations and venues. The search will retrieve a list of matching resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Search words using</h3>
<p>Select how you would like the words to be used in&nbsp;your search.</p>
<ul>
    <li>and (default): to search for all of the words in any order</li>
    <li>or: to search for any of&nbsp;the words</li>
    <li>exact phrase: to search for&nbsp;the words in exactly the order you type them</li>
</ul>

    <li>Date: to sort events in&nbsp;chronological order, most recent first.</li>
    <li>Venue: to sort events in alphabetical order by venue.</li>
    <li>State: to sort events, organisations and venues&nbsp;in alphabetical order by state.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Restrict by year</h3>
<p>Enter a year (e.g. 1999) or&nbsp;year range (e.g. 2002 - 2012) for the event or events you want to find. You can only enter dates when searching for Events and All Records.</p>
<h2><a name="Search_Tips">Search Tips</a></h2>
<h3>Capitalisation</h3>
<p>The word search is not case sensitive. Variations in capitalisation will not affect the search results.</p>
<h3>Diacritics</h3>
<p>AusStage does not use diacritics or letters which are not part of the basic Roman alphabet (A-Z, a-z).&nbsp;When searching for words&nbsp;in languages other than English,&nbsp;use English spelling and letters. For example,&nbsp;to search for 'Françoise'&nbsp;replace the 'ç' (with cedilla) with 'c' (without cedilla): 'Francoise'.</p>
<h3>Wildcard / Truncation&nbsp;(%)</h3>
<p>Use a percentage sign (%)&nbsp;as a wildcard to substitute for one or more letters in a search word. Wildcards may be used within a word or at the start or end of a word. With wildcards, you can match:</p>
<ul>
    <li>both the singular and plural forms of a word</li>
    <li>words that begin with the same root</li>
    <li>words that can be spelled in different ways</li>
</ul>
<p>Use&nbsp;% if you are unsure of the exact spelling or want to search for various forms of a word, alternative spellings or endings, including singular, plural, and different tenses.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>H%let will find Hamlet;</li>
    <li>Will%m will find william and willem;</li>
    <li>Shake% will find Shakepeare and Shakespearian.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>A resource is&nbsp;a review, programme, photograph, video, book, article, collection etc. Resource icons indicate when related resources are recorded.</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
    <li>
    <div style="margin-right: 0px"><img alt="Related Resource" src="%(link4)" /> A grey resource icon indicates that there are resource records relating to an event, contributor, organisation or venue.</div>
