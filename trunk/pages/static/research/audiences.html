<h2>Inviting feedback from audiences using mobile devices</h2>
<p>AusStage provides audience members&nbsp;with opportunities to share their experiences of performance. Recording audience responses to performance is important for companies, researchers, performers and you. It fleshes out our cultural history and will provide future generations with a richer and fuller understanding of what we did, saw, liked and didn't like.</p>
<h2>What artists and companies can do</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="">View audience response</a> - Past performances with feedback you can view</li>
</ul>
<p>Artists and companies can&nbsp;select questions to&nbsp;put to their&nbsp;audiences. They can view audience responses to a particular performance in various ways - as a list in chronological order, as signage for use at a venue, as a tag cloud of key words, or as a sequence of images retrieved for key words. They can also select multiple performances for viewing as a list or as a tag cloud.</p>
<h2>What spectators can do</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="">Send a response</a> - Performances now seeking feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>Spectators can use mobile phones to send text messages, tweet via Twitter or respond online via a mobile web site. Spectators can also register with AusStage to leave comments about performances on the AusStage website.</p>
<p>AusStage does not record or store any identifying information about spectators. It does not record the phone number or web details used by audience members to respond. Audience members cannot be identified in any way by AusStage or any other individuals or&nbsp;parties (including performance companies). Individuals will not be identified in any results and&nbsp;all responses&nbsp;are stored confidentially.</p>
<p>Participation is entirely voluntary. If you&nbsp;choose to&nbsp;have your say about a performance you have seen, standard costs for SMS or internet access will apply. If you are under 18 years of age, you must ask for a parent or guardian's permission to participate. However, please note that sending information via mobile devices is inherently insecure.</p>]]></content>
