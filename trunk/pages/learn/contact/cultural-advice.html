      <content><![CDATA[<h1>Cultural Advice</h1>
<p>AusStage recognises that Flinders University, our host institution, was established on the lands of the Kaurna nation with the main campus located near Warriparinga, a significant site in the complex and multi-layered Dreaming of ancestral being Tjilbruke. Tjilbruke continues to be part of the living culture and traditions of the Kaurna people.</p>
<p>AusStage collects information on live performance in communities across Australia. In collecting information about performances involving Indigenous Australians,  AusStage is guided by the <a href="%(link0)">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library and Information Resources Network Protocols</a>, and by the <a href="%(link1)">Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies</a> from the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.</p>
<p>AusStage users are advised that records contain words and descriptions which may be culturally sensitive and which might not normally be used in certain public or community contexts. Terms and annotations which reflect the author's attitude or that of the period in which the item was written may be considered inappropriate today in some circumstances.</p>
<p>Users are also warned that, in some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities, seeing images of deceased persons in photographs, film and books or hearing them in recordings may cause sadness or distress and in some cases, offend against strongly held cultural prohibitions.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding the cultural aspects of this site, please <a target="_self" href="%(link2)">contact </a>us. We are committed to working with cultural sensitivity and respect, and welcome advice from our users.</p>]]></content>
