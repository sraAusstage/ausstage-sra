      <content><![CDATA[<h1>Networks</h1>
<p>Networks can reveal complex relations between things, people, words and ideas. We can use networks to explore the relations, connections and associations between things in our research.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Who is associated with whom?</li>
    <li>What is connected to what?</li>
    <li>Which goes with this and with that?</li>
</ul>
<p>Visualisations can show us what artistic networks look like, from the outside, as a whole. They can convey information about the position of artists in relation to each other and the nature of their relationships &ndash; when did they arrive in the network, how long were they active, who did they work with, how often, over how long, and so on.</p>
<p>The Network interface provides tools to undertake and substantiate analyses of artistic netorks in live performance which were previously difficult to deliver. Researchers are particularly interested in using this interface to trace lines of artistic contact, influence and cross-fertilization and recognise patterns in career pathways and professional development.</p>
<p>Of course, visualisations can't tell us anything about the substance of artistic relationships. But for those with knowledge of the artists and productions that the network represents, network visualisation can provoke new ways of looking at historical evidence and new modes of story-telling and knowledge formation.</p>
<h2>Who works with whom?</h2>
<p>Some of the founding ideas about social networks were elaborated in the 1930s by Moreno. His research and practice focused on the connection between psychological well-being and the patterning of social relations between people. A key innovation introduced by Moreno in 1933 was the 'sociogram', a technique for depicting individuals as 'points' and their relations as connecting 'lines'. Moreno used the sociogram to envisage how small-scale networks of kinship, friendship, the workplace and so forth aggregate into larger networks such as communities, corporations, and nation-states.</p>
<p>Moreno's interest in networks of social relations has parallels in the performing arts.   Consider the biographies in theatre programs, where the cast and crew each recount their relations with training institutions, theatre companies, leading artists and notable productions. A history of working where, with whom, and on what is how practitioners in the performing arts accumulate and articulate their experience, qualification and distinction. The interactions between artists, as they train, rehearse and work together, have implications for the kinds of artists they become and the kind of performances they make.</p>
<p>The impetus to visualise performing arts data emerges from the accumulation of data in AusStage. There is now, quite simply, more data in AusStage than it is possible to conveniently view on screen as text. Visualisations of various kinds &ndash; including charts, maps, timelines and network graphs &ndash; lend us the synoptic power of abstraction: they provide an opportunity to grasp the whole picture, to see relationships at a distance, where previously we had focused up-close on textual details.</p>
<p>With its relational design, the AusStage database records these networks of contact and collaboration and how they change over time. We are now able to analyse these networks by visualising data from AusStage and exploring 'who works with whom' in an online interface.</p>

<h2>What does the AusStage network look like?</h2>
<p>This visualisation depicts a core sample from more than 1.6 million relationships between artists in the AusStage dataset. Analysing the whole network we learn that there are a few people who are highly connected, and a lot of people with a few connections. The average degree of connection is 42.73, the modal (or most common) degree of connection is 7. The network is very well interconnected. The average shortest path is 3.64 &ndash; which means that whereever an artist is in the network chances are that he or she can be linked to any other artist in less than 4 steps.</p>
<p>Examining the network for clusters of artists who frequently work with each other reveals something fundamental about performance: Theatre is made in the here and now &ndash; and therefore artists tend to work together in clusters, defined by time and place. What connects clusters across time and space are the writers &ndash; the playwrights, composers, lyricists, translators, choreographers and so on &ndash; who are often absent from rehearsal, but who contribute scripts and scores to the production from another time and place.</p>

<h2>Visualising networks in AusStage</h2>
<p>In visualising networks in AusStage, we focus on relationships between contributors and events. A contributor is an individual, usually a person, who contributes in some capacity to the conception, production or presentation of an event. An event is a distinct happening defined by title, date/s and venue; typically, a performance or series of performances at a venue. There are two ways we can look at the relationship between contributors and events.</p>
<table cellpadding="3">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td width="50%" valign="top"><strong>Contributor network</strong> &ndash; We can visualise a network of contributors linked by the events they have collaborated on. A contributor network is centred on one contributor. It shows all the contributors who have collaborated with the central contributor, and all of their collaborations with each other. Relations in a contributor network are mutual: if I've worked with you, you've worked with me.</td>
            <td width="50%" valign="top"><strong>Event network</strong> &ndash; Alternatively we can visualise a network of events linked by their contributors (below right). An event network is centered on one event. It shows the events that contributors were working on before and after the central event. Relations in event networks are directed in time, and show an artist's progression from one event to the next.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a border="0" href="%(link11)"><img width="100%" src="%(link12)" alt="" /></a></td>
            <td><a border="0" href="%(link13)"><img width="100%" src="%(link14)" alt="" /></a></td>

<h2>Network inteface &ndash; design principles</h2>
<p>In designing the network interface for AusStage, we were faced with a series of challenges. How to present researchers with a visual interface for exploring this dataset? Researchers access AusStage through a web browser. How much of the network could we deliver to them online? And how would they navigate through it? Through the course of exploratory research, a set of principles emerged which have guided the development of the network interface.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>A focus on artistic networks</strong> &ndash; While it is possible to use network analysis to visualise various relationships between different entities (organisations, events, venues, genres and so on), our focus is on the artistic networks articulated through the relationships between contributors and events. There is a realism to this focus reflects the collaborative ethic of the performance arts and the obligations of co-presence in the rehearsal room. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>An awareness of complexity</strong> &ndash; As we've just seen, the AusStage contribute network is large and complex. Visualisation efforts using dedicated software are most effective in working on relatively small sub-networks (&lt;20,000 edges, &lt;2,000 nodes) constrained by contributor (ego-centric networks), or by association with particular venues, and organisations. Visualising networks for display in web browsers imposes additional constraints. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>The necessity of focus+context</strong> &ndash; Our experience in using network visualisation for analysis is characterised by zooming in and out &ndash; zooming in to focus on particular artists and relationships, and zooming out to grasp their position within the larger network. This experience is addressed by the visual design principle of 'focus plus context'. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>An interest in quality</strong> &ndash; Our researchers are interested in articulating the significance and quality of artistic collaborations. While these measures imply qualitative research, the are three aspects of data available in AusStage which could assist researchers in identifying quality and significance of a relationship between two or more artists: the number of their collaborations, the frequency of their collaboration over time (and changes in the frequency), their artistic functions (and again, changes in function over time), and their position (or 'betweeness') within an artistic network. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>The significance of time</strong> &ndash; The networks of artistic collaboration in the AusStage dataset are dynamic. They are time-coded by event and they change over time. Experiments in analysing network dynamics in the AusStage data suggest patterns of branching and consolidation, transitions in centrality, and sequences of growth, consolidation, release and reorganisation (Walker and Salt 2006). Yet approaches to analysing dynamic networks are at the leading edge of the field. Refining techniques for visualisation, including timelines, animation and 3D, will entail experimentation.</li>
