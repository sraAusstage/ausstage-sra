</ul>
<p>AusStage supports researchers at each stage of the process:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Planning - deciding what to research - extending the horizon - research proposals and funding applications</li>
    <li>Process - finding out who has done what - exploring coverage of existing data - literature review and bibliography</li>
    <li>Content - creating, gathering and doing the research - collecting new data - curation and analysis</li>
