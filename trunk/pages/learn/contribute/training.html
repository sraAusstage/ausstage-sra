<p>AusStage welcomes contributions from our users. We provide training to equip users with the knowledge to create, edit and copy records for events and resources.</p>
<p>Data entry is currently undertaken in many locations around Australia including Darwin, Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra,&nbsp; Launceston, Ballarat, Perth and Adelaide. People participating in data entry range from academic performance researchers, to library and collections staff as well as volunteers with an interest in performance history in Australia.</p>
<p>Contributing to AusStage is a great way to keep up to date with live performance in Australia, and to take part in an important and ever-expanding record of Australia&rsquo;s cultural history. AusStage benefits researchers, performance companies, students, audiences and arts practitioners alike.</p>
<p>The training process focuses on data entry protocols and procedures. It takes around an hour and can be done in person or via telephone or Skype, depending on your location and needs.&nbsp; Once training is complete, we offer ongoing support and advice as you get underway with creating and updating records.</p>
<p>To enter data into AusStage you will need access to a computer with an internet connection and a standard web browser. Our data entry manual is available online or as a hardcopy which can be sent to you in the post.</p>
<p>To register for a training session, please contact <a target="_self" href="%(link0)">Jenny Fewster</a>, the AusStage Project Manager.</p>]]></content>
