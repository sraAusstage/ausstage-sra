      <content><![CDATA[<h1>Editorial</h1>
<p>AusStage developed a new editorial process during our fourth phase of development in 2010 and 2011. This process enables expert members of the AusStage network to review and amend existing records and oversee the content of new records. The process has been agreed upon through national consultation. It is documented in the AusStage manual and encoded into the database.</p>
<p>AusStage encourages researchers to share their knowledge with each other. Researchers use AusStage to retrieve information about performance. The editorial process adds a new layer of citation and review. Editorial review complements our &lsquo;citizen science&rsquo; approach by drawing on expertise among users to enhance the quality of data and share knowledge, experience and expertise.</p>
<p>An Editorial Board was established for AusStage. The Editorial Board advises AusStage on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>developing policy for data quality, extent of information, and conformity with data-searching capabilities;</li>
    <li>standardising existing records in line with editorial guidelines, focusing in particular on qualitative aspects of event description, the allocation of genre categories, content indicators and status designators;</li>
    <li>developing, testing and implementing the database technology for the new editorial process; and</li>
    <li>improving the AusStage user interface to encourage high-quality contributions from users as well as enhanced browsing by date, region, genre categories, content indicators and contributor roles.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Currently, the Editorial Board are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Associate Professor Tom Burvill, Macquarie University;</li>
    <li>Professor Adrian Kiernander, University of New England;</li>
    <li>Professor Veronica Kelly, University of Queensland;</li>
    <li>Mr. John McCallum, University of New South Wales;</li>
    <li>Mr. Geoffrey Milne, La Trobe University;</li>
    <li>Professor Joanne Tompkins, University of Queensland.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of editorial review is supported by the Data Review Board, a wide network of experts providing assistance to the Project Manager in reviewing records as they are created in AusStage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Event records which have been reviewed will display details of who reviewed the record and on what date. If a reviewed record is subsequently updated by an AusStage member who is not classified as a reviewer that record will lose its reviewed status. Not all the existing records in the database will be reviewed; members of the Review Board will adopt a data-set and a computer program called D-Dupe will help identify the records in most urgent need of revising. Although event records will be the focus of this process, contributor and venue data will also be subject to review. AusStage partners are engaging research experts and user communities to review records in line with editorial guidelines. Standardisation of records has been a focus with the incorporation into AusStage of data from Professor Veronica Kelly&rsquo;s Australian Drama Bibliography project. Work on a targeted program to stimulate data contributions from artists is ongoing.</p>
