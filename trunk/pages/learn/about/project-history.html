      <content><![CDATA[<h1>Project History</h1>
<p>AusStage was instigated by the <a href="%(link0)" target="_self">Australasian Drama Studies Association</a> (ADSA) in 1999. Theatre scholars from eight Australian universities joined with the Australia Council, the Performing Arts Special Interest Group (PASIG) and industry representative, Playbox Theatre. Together they set out to address the need for research information in Australian theatre, drama and performance studies by building an index of performing arts events in Australia, and a directory of research resources on the performing arts.<br />
<br />
The AusStage project established a national online database of theatre research, bringing together many existing resources from within the participating universities and other theatre research organisations, and catering for future data collection and collaborative research. The project set out to deliver both the hardware and the software needed by researchers to curate an extensive dataset on live performance in Australia, and to handle complex relational queries across three strands of research: Australian theatre history; the cultural and commercial analysis of the production and consumption of performances; and audience analysis. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Phase 1: 2000-2002</h2>
<p>The Australian Research Council supported the establishment of AusStage, through the Research Infrastructure and Equipment Fund. This grant was augmented by&nbsp;additional contributions from&nbsp;eight participating universities: Flinders, La Trobe, Queensland, UNSW, UWA, UNE, Newcastle and the QUT. Work began in January 2000 and was completed by the end of 2002. The outcome was a prototype data model with enough data to ensure its efficacy and provide a sound basis for future developments.</p>
<h2>Phase 2: 2003-2005</h2>
<p>The university partners continued their collaboration with a second round of ARC funding in 2003. In early 2004, the partnership was extended with the inclusion of Curtin University. Focusing on issues of storage, retrieval and sustainability, Phase 2 substantially re-organised the database and improved the online interfaces. Data entry was the main focus of activity in phase 2 - the number of event records increased from 7,000 to 35,000.</p>
<h2>Phase 3: 2006-2008</h2>
<p>In 2006 AusStage expanded its partnership to twenty-two organisations with the involvement of a further eleven universities: Edith Cowan, Murdoch, Ballarat, Sydney, Melbourne, Western Sydney, Monash, Wollongong, Adelaide, Macquarie and Deakin. In 2007 the consortium received a third round of funding through the ARC's Linkage Infrastructure Equipment and Facilities (LIEF) scheme. Phase 3 set out to transform the AusStage database into a platform for collaborative research across three programs:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Building resource links:</strong> We implemented the technical capacity to construct persistent links between event records in AusStage and digitised resources in institutional digital repositories. These links streamline research pathways between AusStage and online collections, leading to new methods and efficiencies in performing arts e-research. We also implemented the new resource and work tables; migrated data from article table and resource directory into the resource table; and implemented new interfaces for creating, editing, searching and browsing resource records.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustaining data entry:</strong> We developed a sustainable strategy for prospective data entry across the country by drawing on a national network of data sources, targeting key organisations including companies, government agencies, collections and publishers. We also reviewed and improved protocols for genre classification and attribution of content indicators to event records; redesigned the public search interface, improved record display and enhanced mechanisms for user feedback.</li>
    <li><strong>Cultivating e-research capacity:</strong> Partner research projects cultivated e-research capacity in the performing arts by developing the interactive potential of AusStage for researchers and postgraduates, and pioneering new e-research methodologies. Three e-research clusters were formed within AusStage: Mapping regional clusters of live performance activity; Visualising networks of collaboration between artists over time; and integrating publications and performance as research.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AusStage database continued to grow. At the end of phase 3, we held records on 46,000 performance events, 77,000 contributors, 8,600 organisations, 5,600 venues and 40,000 articles, books, programs, images, videos and archival items relating to those events.</p>
<h2>Phase 4: 2009-2011</h2>
<p>AusStage continued its program of collaborative research and development with a fourth round of ARC LIEF funding for 2010. Researchers worked with AusStage across six projects:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Harnessing Expertise</strong>: We developed new infrastructure to harness the collective intelligence of the research network, and established an editorial board to provide authoritative verification of data.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Searching: </strong>We created a portable digitisation laboratory, providing researchers with the technical equipment and expertise to digitise all resource documentation integral to contextualisation of live performance. Researchers archived items in institutional repositories and created linked records within the AusStage database.</li>
    <li><strong>Mapping Events:</strong> We recorded geographic coordinates, where possible, for all Australian venues in the database and used geo-coding as a basis for interrogating the cartography of theatre production across Australia.</li>
    <li><strong>Navigating Networks:&nbsp;</strong>We drew on network analysis and the new network interface to enhance the representation of artists and their relationships in the AusStage user interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Researching Audiences</strong>: We piloted the mobile audience research service by designing, testing and refining a robust and reliable audience research method using an automated content analysis system to aggregate audience response data and visualise results.</li>
    <li><strong>Modelling Knowledge</strong>: We developed the information architecture for AusStage's evolution from a customised relational database to a standards-based ontology and re-engineered the database to take advantage of advances in open source software for information management.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Aus-e-Stage Project (NeAT)</h3>
<p>The Aus-e-Stage project ran from mid-2009 to mid-2011 with funding from the National eResearch Architecture Taskforce (NeAT) under the Australian Government&rsquo;s Platforms for Collaboration initiative. Aus-e-Stage set out to provide researchers with new platform-independent, remotely accessible and visually interactive interfaces to the AusStage database. Three new services were designed, tested and deployed to operate alongside our conventional text-based search-and-retrieval service.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <strong>Mapping Events</strong> service is an interactive, map-based interface with which to search, manage and display AusStage data. Users are able to generate geographic displays of venues and associated events, zoom from global-scale to street-level, control and animate time-ranges, and trajectory-track organisations, productions and artists on tour.</li>
    <li>The<strong> Navigating Networks</strong> service provides an interactive interface for exploring the network of artistic collaborations embedded in the AusStage dataset. Node-link network graphs depict artists and their collaborations, using existing data to &lsquo;humanise&rsquo; the collaborative ethic of the performing arts.</li>
    <li>The<strong> Researching Audiences</strong> service is a mobile interface which allows AusStage to collate location-based input from users, providing AusStage with immediate, on-location, experience-near data relating to Australian performing arts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Seeding the Commons (ANDS)</h3>
<p>In 2010, AusStage was funded through the Australian National Data Service to increase discovery and re-use of the AusStage dataset by improving data storage; reformatting the dataset as RDF/OWL to support re-use; making policy and project documentation and code available online; and exposing the dataset to re-use through an open access web-based application-programming interface (API).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Australian Access Federation (AAF)</h3>
<p>The Federating Access to AusStage project commenced in early 2010. With funding from the Australian Access Federation (AAF), the project significantly advanced researcher involvement in AusStage by; increasing personnel, expanding the dataset and providing researchers with federated access to the &lsquo;back end&rsquo; administration and editorial areas of AusStage. Further work was done to integrate AusStage&rsquo;s migration to an open source content management system (OpenCMS) with the AAF.</p>
<h2>Phase 5: 2012-2014</h2>
<h3>HuNI - Humanities Networked Infrastructure (NeCTAR)</h3>
<p>AusStage is a partner in the two-year virtual laboratory project by National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR). The Humanities Networked Infrastructure (HuNI) virtual laboratory will provide Australian and international arts and humanities researchers access to the combined resources of Australia&rsquo;s foremost cultural datasets. The virtual laboratory was conceived by the Cultural Dataset Consortium (CDC) &ndash; curators, managers and researchers &ndash; and will facilitate improved data-sharing between researchers and greater interoperation between Australia&rsquo;s most important cultural datasets. The project aims to open up new forms of humanities and arts research and enhance Australian cultural understanding across time. It will operate during 2012 and 2013.<br />
